A:  Dicey because, I mean, it seems, from my reading of it, these facilities are spread out here pretty far and wide in Iran. It's not like when Israel bombed Iraq years ago.  You know, there was just one site to strike.  There are multiple sites.  And they are deep in the ground.  And there is no clear indication that we can knock them out.  Is that correct?
B:  That's basically correct.
